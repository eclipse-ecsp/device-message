## Getting Started

Device configuration data are created and maintained in Mongo DB with the attributes like data, domain, version, command etc. Device message consists of below component, which is used to publish device configuration.
* device-message-api

To build the project in the local working directory after the project has been cloned/forked, run:

```mvn clean install```

from the command line interface.

### Prerequisites

1. The list of tools required to build and run the project:
    JDK 17
    Apache Maven 3.8

Download and Install Apache Maven 3.8 locally and follow the below steps for IntelliJ IDE:
* Go to the right corner of the IDE and get inside the Maven option.
* Select the Maven Settings option and set the Maven Home Path to the path of the Apache Maven 3.8 installed locally.
* Click Apply and then OK.

2. Mongo DB need to installed and ignite database/schema should be created with the required tables.

* Link of the database and table scripts to be installed : 

3. Add the below Json in separate files in the Vault(a component to store tokens and keys):

```
{
  "device-message-api": {
    "mqtt_user_password": "ops-manual"
  }
}
```
* mqtt_user_password : Password details to connect with MQTT.

### Installation

### Coding style check configuration

[checkstyle.xml](./checkstyle.xml) is the coding standard to follow while writing new/updating existing code.

Checkstyle plugin [maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.2.1](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/) is integrated in [pom.xml](./pom.xml) which runs in the `validate` phase and `check` goal of the maven lifecycle and fails the build if there are any checkstyle errors in the project.

There are a few coding guidelines to be followed manually before requesting for a pull request, the same can be found here:

[Manual coding guidelines](Link to page with coding guidelines)

### Running the tests

To run the tests for this system run the below maven command.

```mvn test```

Or run a specific test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheFirstUnitTest"```

To run a method from within a test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheSecondUnitTest#whenTestCase2_thenPrintTest2_1"```

### Deployment

We can deploy this component as a Kubernetes pod by installing Device Message charts.

Link:
[Charts](../../../csp-opensource-charts/tree/main/device-message)

Detailed information about the request and response generated by the [Device-Message restful services](Refer to API specifics of device-message).

## Architecture

Sequence diagram of Device Message:

## Usage

Device Message component is responsible for interfacing all communication with the device. Inbound messages are routed via Device Messaging before services process the messages. Outgoing messages from services to devices are also routed via Device Messaging. Under the hood it does a lot more keeping track of device connection status with hivemq, persisting events in database if vehicle is inactive, waking up a device if its inactive , retrying events if device has not received it etc.
